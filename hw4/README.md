SCRABBLE IS CRAZY but fun at the same time. I'd be enjoying this much more if I had more time. Anyways, still gotta work on
the ? mark, the adjacency for Place, and a seg fault I just found.
Now I understand the point of this class: to break everyone down to weed out the weak. I get it. I ain't quittin' though.
Enjoy grading. Leniency would be nice. I'm sure you went through the same thing.
